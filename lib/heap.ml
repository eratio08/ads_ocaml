(*
   A binomial tree of rank 0 is a singleton node.
   A binomial tree of rank r + 1 is formed by linking two binomial trees of rank r, making one tree the leftmost child of the other.
   A binomial tree of rank r is a node with r children t1...tr, where each ti is a binomial tree of rank r â€” i

   Trees of equal rank are always linked using `link`.
